# The Modern React Bootcamp (Hooks, Context, NextJS, Router) Course by Colt Steele
## Just published! Follow the same curriculum I teach my students in SF. 10+ projects including one HUGE application!

### The highlights:

- Learn React, from the very basics up to advanced topics like Next JS, React Router, Higher Order Components and Hooks and the Context API.
- Build one massive capstone application, complete with drag & drop, animations, route transitions, complex form validations, and more.
- Learn the latest in React, including Hooks (my favorite part of React!).  We build a complete app using Hooks, including multiple custom hooks.
- Learn state management using the useContext and useReducer hooks, to mimic some of the functionality of Redux.
- You get tons of detailed handouts and cheatsheets that you can refer back to whenever you need to.   Think of this as a React textbook you can study at any point if you get tired of videos.
